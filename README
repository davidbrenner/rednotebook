===== Short Instructions =====

Install all dependencies, translate the application and run RedNotebook
without installation:

$ ./run



===== Detailed Instructions =====

There are many packages available for different distributions, so you might
want to check the Downloads page first.

It is recommended to install the distribution's appropriate package,
but of course sometimes you want to try out the bleeding edge, hot new stuff.

If you don't want to mess with your distribution's package system, you might
want to just run the program, without installing it by using the command above.

==== REQUIREMENTS ====
  - Python (2.6/2.7) (www.python.org)
  - PyYaml (>=3.05) (www.pyyaml.org)
  - PyGTK (>=2.16) (www.pygtk.org)
  - pywebkitgtk (>=1.1.5) (http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/)

  - Optionally:
    - python-chardet (http://chardet.feedparser.org)
      Better recognition of file encodings

==== INSTALLATION ====
Please pay attention: Installing is very easy, uninstalling however can only be
done by removing the installed files manually.

$ sudo python setup.py install --record installed-files

(installs into path-to-python/site-packages/ and saves a list of installed
files in "installed-files" to make an uninstallation easier)
